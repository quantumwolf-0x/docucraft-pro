/**
 * Lets a block that already owns a row of overlay controls render its own save
 * affordance inside that row.
 *
 * The markdown viewer's default is a star floating in the block's corner, which
 * works for a table or a code fence. On a diagram it did not: the star was a
 * separate surface sitting beside the diagram's control tray, and because it was
 * a sibling of the stage rather than part of it, hovering the star took the
 * pointer off the stage and faded the rest of the controls away.
 *
 * Publishing the action instead of the button lets the diagram place it as one
 * more segment of its tray, so it looks and behaves like every button next to
 * it. Lives in its own module so `Mermaid` can consume it without importing the
 * markdown viewer that provides it.
